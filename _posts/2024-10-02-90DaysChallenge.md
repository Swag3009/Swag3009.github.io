## Introduction 
Life is about continuous growth. We often waste time procrastinating or resting, believing it’s okay to delay our progress, but real happiness comes from the satisfaction of doing better and pushing our limits. It’s the victory after overcoming challenges that brings true joy. The harder the battle, the more fulfilling the win.

But when we constantly procrastinate, avoid our goals, and chase temporary fixes, we end up feeling stuck and unhappy. We become frustrated because, deep down, we know we’re not addressing the real issues.

I’ve always understood this, but I never acted on it. Knowing something isn't enough—knowledge is just potential power. It's only when you put that knowledge into action that it becomes truly valuable. Now, it’s time to act, to stop waiting and start building the life I want.

### Why 90-Days Challenge?

These 90 days are all about regaining the confidence I once had. Rather than being completely affected by the outside world, I want to gain control over my inner self. I want to transform into the person I admire—a version of myself that I’ll be proud to be. With a problem-solving mindset and a positive attitude, this challenge is about becoming a better, stronger me.

## Problems I Want to Solve

No matter how much we try to escape our problems, true victory comes from adopting a problem-solving mindset and addressing the issues that hold us back. Here are the areas in my character that I’m not proud of and want to improve:
1. **Extremely Vulnerable to External Factors :** *I constantly seek validation from external events and people. My emotions are heavily influenced by others' thoughts and actions, and I struggle with self-control. I often hold myself accountable for others' feelings, expecting them to validate me in return. This unhealthy behavior, as I learned from an article by [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/boundaries), compels me to make others responsible for my emotions.*

2. **Lack of Respect and Love for Myself :** *We often forget that love is a verb. Simply saying "I love myself" isn’t enough if my actions don’t reflect it. True self-love comes from showing respect and care for my body, practicing compassion, and being grateful for who I am. Without these actions, any verbal declaration of self-love feels hollow.*

3. **Inability to Keep Promises :** *Breaking promises has become a habit, whether to myself or to others. I not only fail to keep them but often forget them altogether. This makes me someone who can’t stand by her word, which is something I deeply dislike. Integrity matters to me, and failing to keep promises makes me look down on myself.*

4. **Addiction to Devices and Lack of Self-Control :** *It’s become so easy to get a dopamine hit through technology, but it weakens our ability to focus on hard, necessary tasks and can lead to depression. While we get temporary happiness from watching videos, reels, constantly scrolling from one content to another, deep down we know we haven't been productive, which causes us to feel worse. As an introverted loner, it's easy for me to escape into the virtual world, but this offers only short-term happiness, not lasting satisfaction.*

## Understanding the Solution

1. **Let go and be my biggest cheerleader :**
- *Constructive criticism is always accepted, but others are not taken.*
- *Understand my own boundaries and stand by them, rather than molding them for each person.*
- *Accept that people will have their own judgments, and I don't need to take them personally, just as I have judgments about others.*
- *Be unapologetically myself, focusing on who I am rather than trying to become something for others' acceptance.*
- *Learn to accept others' "no" and say "no" to people when necessary.*
- *Recognize that sometimes I don't need to take myself too seriously, and other times I don't need to take others seriously.*
- *Learn, understand, and implement the concepts of healthy relationships with myself and others.*
- *Focus on myself entirely*

2. **Show Love Via Action :** It's so weird that we enjoy doing things that are harmful to our body, yet we claim to love ourselves and justify it as treating ourselves. Love is verb, it's something you do, reactive people consider it as feeling. 
- *Choose to do things that are genuinely good for my body.*
- *Choose people who are good for my mental and emotional health.*
- *Choose to engage in activities that provide a true sense of value and purpose in my life.*

3. **Developing Integrity :** Lies have become so common in our daily lives that even when we're running late, we lack the courage to speak the truth. This makes fake promises easy. Another major reason for breaking promises is that we make and break them according to our own convenience.
- *Start small by being honest with myself and keeping the small promises I make.*
- *Be cautious and thoughtful when making promises, ensuring they are ones I can truly keep.*
- *Once a promise is made, give 100% effort to fulfill it.*

4. **Breaking the Cycle of Addiction :**  Addiction often stems from a lack of inner control, becoming an escape from feelings and problems we avoid. But avoidance only deepens the problem, creating a false sense of peace while making us feel empty inside. The more we run, the stronger the addiction grows, doubling the issues. The only way to break this cycle is by:
- *Taking control of your addiction, instead of letting it control you. Actively manage and reduce your dependency.* 
- *Gaining control over your inner self. Rather than avoiding a problem, developing problem solving mindset and take action with resilience.*

## The Goal I Want to Achieve in 90 Days
I understand that no drastic, life-changing results will happen after 90 days, and setting high expectations could deprive me of enjoying the progress and small victories I'll achieve during the time. This challenge is for me—an opportunity to be open to change and break habits that don’t serve me. My main goal is to feel a sense of pride and improvement in myself. The outcome isn’t in my control, so I won’t worry about it. Instead, I’ll focus on what I can control: my actions.

**कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।  
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि॥**

 I trust that my efforts won’t be in vain. Even if results don’t appear immediately, I know that eventually, I’ll reap the benefits of my hard work.

### Target I Want to Achieve

- Establish a routine of sleeping and waking up at consistent times.
- Eat foods that are healthy and suitable for my body.
- Overcome device addiction and reduce screen time.
- Become more conscious of how I spend my time each day.
- Practice positive thinking and gratitude regularly.
- Develop a problem-solving mindset.
- Cultivate the habit of enjoying reading every day.

### Even if I Lose My Target, What Shall I Achieve

Even if I fail to build these habits in 90 days, I will still have a sense of peace knowing that I tried. Failure may not bring the joy of success, but it offers valuable experiences and lessons that success cannot. It will teach me more about myself and help rebuild my confidence. Every new experience and lesson changes us in some way. While some changes are drastic and noticeable, others are gradual and subtle, but they all contribute to personal growth.

## What I Plan to Execute

After struggling with various health issues, I’ve finally realized that good health is the foundation upon which we can build everything else—our career, relationships, and social responsibilities. As my grandfather often reminded me with the Sanskrit sloka **"शरीरमाद्यं खलु धर्म साधनम्"** (śarīramādyaṁ khalu dharma sādhanaṁ), our body is the primary means of fulfilling our duties. It took me a long time to fully grasp this and take it seriously.

There are many aspects of life I’ve wanted to work on, and I’ve tried, but without a healthy body, reaching my goals becomes significantly harder. I no longer want to use my poor health as an excuse. It’s no longer a reason but an excuse—something within my control, but I’ve avoided addressing. So, these 90 days are dedicated to building a strong foundation by focusing on achieving a healthy body and mind.

### Making It Actionable

#### Health
1. **Food**:
   - *Avoid: deep fried, ultra processed, sugar, gluten food*

3. *Use my tablet only for study purposes*
4. *Set a particular time to use my phone to do the tasks that are written down on paper, and use it outside of my room*

## What I've Tried Before and What I'm Doing Differently

I've had the same resolution for a long time: to sleep and wake up on time, eat healthy, exercise regularly, meditate, practice affirmations, read daily, and gain more control over myself and my time. I’ve tried countless challenges—7 days, 21 days, 30 days, 66 days, 100 days—but I could never follow through.

Whenever I approached the end of a challenge, I would feel eager to stop, dreading the last day. And as soon as the challenge ended, I slipped back into my old habits. Why? Because I thought of these habits as temporary—something I’d only do for the duration of the challenge. I never embraced them as a lifestyle, nor did I enjoy them.

The difference this time is in my mindset. I’ve learned that having the right attitude—staying positive and willing—makes these habits easier to embrace. If I stop practicing them after 90 days and return to my old ways, then this challenge will have been meaningless. To succeed, I need to find joy and excitement in these tasks instead of just waiting for the challenge to be over.

And when you have to do something, why not enjoy the process? The work may not change, but your attitude toward it certainly does. I'll try my best to enjoy each day of these 90 days and every task along the way, so that I never think of reverting to my lazy, ineffective lifestyle. This isn’t a sacrifice I’m making for my dreams—this is an investment I’m making in myself.

Making lasting changes requires two things: the habit either needs to be small enough that it feels effortless, or it needs to be enjoyable enough that putting in the effort doesn’t feel like a burden.

## Mindset for 90 Days

I'm a person who relies heavily on emotions to get things done. I act based on how I feel at the moment, and as a result, I lack self-control and rarely accomplish anything productive. This mindset isn't going to get me anywhere, so it's time to change my thinking. These are the philosophies I’ll remind myself of repeatedly, and I'll strive to follow them:

- **You don't feel like doing it? DO IT ANYWAY.** You’re feeling tired? DO IT ANYWAY. Some hurdle came your way? DO IT ANYWAY. You have five excuses not to do it? DO IT ANYWAY. No matter what, what needs to be done has to be done. So just do it anyway.
  
- **FOCUS ON YOURSELF**—on your feelings, actions, reactions, situation, opportunities, habits, thoughts, behavior, identity, and what you are and what you want. Whenever you start comparing yourself with others, trying to control others, or getting angry at people or situations, bring the focus back to yourself.

- **One day at a time, one task at a time.** Focus on what's in front of you instead of worrying about what's far on the horizon.

- **When fate hands you lemons, make lemonade.** Instead of complaining about the situation or worrying about things you can't control, focus on what you can control. Make the best out of what you have.

- **You can't enjoy the world and its luxuries from your coffin.** Never trade your health for money. If you focus on your health, feel better, and work better, you'll earn the money you desire. Good health is the root of prosperity.

## My 90-Day Challenge: Watch the Journey!
I'm currently staying in a hostel, so I’m unsure how consistently I can make videos, but I’ll try to update my progress as much as possible. In this video, I share my 90-day challenge plan.

## Conclusion
In the end, this 90-day challenge is not just a temporary endeavor but a stepping stone toward becoming the person I want to be. It's not about expecting drastic changes or instant results—it's about embracing the journey of improvement and growth. Each small step I take toward better health, stronger habits, and a more focused mindset will contribute to a bigger transformation over time.

There will be days when I don’t feel like doing the work, but this challenge is a reminder that real change happens when you push through discomfort and rise above your excuses. By shifting my mindset, taking control of my actions, and focusing on what I can change, I will not only build new habits but also cultivate a sense of pride and self-respect that can last beyond these 90 days.

This isn’t a sacrifice; it’s an investment in myself, in my future, and in the life I truly want to live. And even if I stumble along the way, I’ll know that I’ve tried, and that effort alone will teach me more than staying in my comfort zone ever could. Every day, I’ll remind myself that this challenge is not just about finishing 90 days—it's about setting the foundation for a lifetime of growth, health, and fulfillment.
